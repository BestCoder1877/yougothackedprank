# You Got Hacked!
Trick a windows user into thinking they got hacked 

## Instructions:

Download the .bat file (the .bat file uses a RTLO to make it look like a .shortcut file) and try and trick the victim into opening it

## You Got Hacked Site:

I am currently hosting this You Got Hacked page at https://files.bestcoder1877.qzz.io/yougothacked.html As a discalaimer i did AI generate this website but the i made the actual bat file


## The matrix animation

some of you might have noticed that at the end of the .bat file i am calling a suspicious looking powershell script: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/avdaredevil/matrix/master/Matrix.ps1 . I did not make this script but looking through the script it does not look like malware. This script was made by [Avdaredevil](https://github.com/avdaredevil) in his repo called [Matrix](https://github.com/avdaredevil/matrix) on github.
